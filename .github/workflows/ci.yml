          # (which is what `op build` does), we need to use `op` itself.
          #
          # Uniquely for this repo, we must first build the binary from source (previous step),
          # and then use that just-built binary to orchestrate the container build.
          #
          # Users of `op` will simply download the pre-built binary or use the Action,
          # they do NOT need to implement this bootstrapping pattern.
